# Text to Image using StackGAN
- This is just a model training, and the results shown are till 20 epochs, but code written is till 500 epochs and if having a better GPU and better RAM, final results would have been achieved.
- Implemented a StackGAN architecture for a project dedicated to converting textual descriptions into realistic images, based on the datasets added.
- Led a collaborative team through the entire lifecycle of the StackGAN-based project, from commencement to training, resulting in the successful generation of 256x256 realistic images from textual input.
